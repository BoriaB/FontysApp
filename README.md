# FontysApp
We1 have been asked to produce a front and back end exam procedures monitor for Fontys university. At the moment Fontys is using an application that TUe university has produced couple of years ago. Fontys has decided to redesign this technology because the Tue application can no longer fulfill the requirements of Fontys university exam procedure and also ICT department of Fontys believes that the purpose of existing software does not match with the new requirement of exam procedure in university.
